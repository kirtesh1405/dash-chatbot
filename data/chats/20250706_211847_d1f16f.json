Place the flat side of the cabbage on the cutting board and slice it into thin strips. You can also chop the strips into smaller pieces if desired.\n\n4. If you want to shred the cabbage, slice the strips into even thinner pieces.\n\n5. If the recipe calls for wedges or chunks of cabbage, cut each half into quarters and then slice out the core from each quarter. From there, you can chop the cabbage into wedges or chunks as needed.\n\n6. Rinse the chopped cabbage under running water to remove any dirt or debris.\n\nAnd that's how you can easily cut a cabbage for your recipe!"
